# TODO-App
TODO web application.
this code has been updated and is now complete
it is a simple todo app that can add list of todo items. you can filter the list by done, undone and all
this todo list also stores your list items to local storage so when ever you refresh th e page, you still have your items there.
this code was written in html, css and javascript and was created from a follow along tutorial by Dev Ed on youtube. you can check out his channel for the full video tutorial :)
